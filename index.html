    <p>A <b>website</b> (also written as a web site) is a <i>collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server.</i> Websites are typically dedicated to a <mark>particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment or social networking.</mark> Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page. As of May 2023, the <b>top 5 most visited websites are Google Search, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.</b>
        All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the <mark><b>World Wide Web</b></mark>. There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a <i>private network, such as a company's internal website for its employees<i></i>. Users can access websites on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The app used on these devices is called a web browser.</p>
